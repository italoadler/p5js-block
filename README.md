### To Contribute
```
cd /wp-content/plugins/p5js/
npm install
npm run
```

# 

### To Remember
* Currently, this plugin does not work with `createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight)`. You'll need to use actual integer values like, `createCanvas(700, 400)`.
* Currently, this plugin does not include the `p5.dom.js` or the `p5.sound.js` libraries.
